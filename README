Nodepool
========

Nodepool is a service used by the OpenStack CI team to deploy and manage a pool
of devstack images on a cloud server for use in OpenStack project testing.

Developer setup
===============

mysql -u root

mysql> create database nodepool;
mysql> GRANT ALL ON nodepool.* TO 'nodepool'@'localhost';
mysql> flush privileges;

nodepool -d -c tools/fake.yaml

After each run (the fake nova provider is only in-memory):

mysql> delete from snapshot_image; delete from node;
